Elon Musk's meteoric ride hit a speed bump in June when one of his SpaceX rockets, on its way to resupply the International Space Station, exploded two minutes into the trip. The failed mission is part of a $1.6 billion contract that Musk's private spacecraft company has with NASA to resupply the International Space Station. Thanks in part to that contract, Musk, who initially invested $100 million of his own money in SpaceX, raised $1 billion from new investors including Google and Fidelity in January 2015, valuing the company north of $10 billion. Tesla Motors, the luxury electric carmaker he founded and runs, is gearing up for the release of the Model X sports-utility vehicle in 2016 and struggling to both turn a profit and meet demand for its Model S sedans. The South African-born Musk emigrated to Canada at age 17 and then to the U.S. as a transfer student to the University of Pennsylvania. He made his first fortune as a cofounder of Paypal, and is the chairman and principal shareholder of SolarCity, the publicly-traded solar panel designer and installer run by his cousin, Lyndon Rive. In 2013, Musk unveiled the Hyperloop, a design for a high-speed transportation system that would send riders through tubes in pods. In June 2015 SpaceX announced it would hold a competition for students and independent engineering teams to design pods and test them on the company's one-mile track.
